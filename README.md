A beautiful and challenging memory game created in C#.

This game is a classic memory game where players must match pairs of cards. Shuffle the cards and place them face down on the board. Players take turns turning over two cards at a time. If the two cards match, they are removed from the board. If the two cards do not match, they are turned back over. The game continues until all the cards have been matched.

This game was created as a required project in my studies. I am happy to share it with others and hope you enjoy playing it.
